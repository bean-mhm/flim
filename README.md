# üéûÔ∏è flim - Bean's Filmic Transform

## Introduction

flim is an experimental film emulation transform that can be used for:

1. Displaying Digital Open-Domain (HDR) Images
2. Color Grading
3. Post-Processing in Video Games and Shaders ("tone-mapping")

## Scripts

The code is structured in the following way:

| Script | Role | Uses |
|---|---|---|
| main.py | Generates a 3D LUT for flim | flim.py  |
| flim.py | Transforms a given linear 3D LUT table | utils.py |
| utils.py | Contains helper functions | - |

Here are the external libraries required to run the scripts:

 - [Colour](https://www.colour-science.org/)
 
 - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
 
 - [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

## Using the LUT

First, a few notes:

 - flim's 3D LUT is designed to be used in an [OpenColorIO](https://opencolorio.org/) (OCIO) environment, but depending on your software and environment, you might be able to manually replicate the transforms in your custom pipeline.
 
 - flim only supports the sRGB display format as of now.

If `main.py` runs successfully, you should see a file named `flim.spi3d` in the same directory. Alternatively, you can look up the latest LUT - no pun intended - in the [releases](https://github.com/bean-mhm/flim/releases) section, which may be outdated.

The LUT's expected input and output formats are mentioned in the LUT comments at end of the file. The following is an example of the LUT comments (note that this might not match the latest version).

```
# -------------------------------------------------
# 
# flim v0.5.0 - Bean's Filmic Transform
# 
# LUT input is expected to be in Linear BT.709 I-D65 and gone through an AllocationTransform like the following:
# !<AllocationTransform> {allocation: lg2, vars: [-11, 12, 0.00048828125]}
# 
# Output will be in sRGB 2.2.

### OCIO Example

Here's an example of how you can add flim to an OCIO config:

```yaml
colorspaces:
  - !<ColorSpace>
    name: flim
    family: Image Formation
    equalitygroup: ""
    bitdepth: unknown
    description: flim - Bean's Filmic Transform
    isdata: false
    allocation: uniform
    from_scene_reference: !<GroupTransform>
      children:
        - !<ColorSpaceTransform> {src: Linear CIE-XYZ I-E, dst: Linear BT.709 I-D65}
        - !<RangeTransform> {min_in_value: 0., min_out_value: 0.}
        - !<AllocationTransform> {allocation: lg2, vars: [-11, 12, 0.00048828125]}
        - !<FileTransform> {src: flim.spi3d, interpolation: linear}
```

1. Paying attention to the transforms, you will notice a `ColorSpaceTransform` from `Linear CIE-XYZ I-E` to `Linear BT.709 I-D65`. This is because the example OCIO config has its reference color space (the `reference` role) set to `Linear CIE-XYZ I-E`. If your config already uses `Linear BT.709 I-D65` (Linear Rec.709) as its reference this is not needed. If your config uses another color space as its reference, you should manually do a conversion to `Linear BT.709 I-D65`. You can get the conversion matrices using the [Colour](https://www.colour-science.org/) library.

2. Then, we have a `RangeTransform` which is there to eliminate negative values in out-of-gamut triplets. This is not the best approach as it might cause weird transitions in images that have been converted from a wider gamut and have a lot of negative values.

3. Next, we have an `AllocationTransform` which can be directly copied from the LUT comments. The `AllocationTransform` here takes the log2 of the tristimulus (RGB) values and maps them from the specified range (the first two values after `vars`) to the [0, 1] range. The third value in `vars` is the initial offset applied to the values. This is done to keep the blacks.

4. Finally, a `FileTransform` references the 3D LUT.

Here's an example of how you can add flim as a view transform to an OCIO config:

```yaml
displays:
  sRGB:
    - !<View> {name: flim, colorspace: flim}
    ...
```

> `...` refers to the other view transforms in the config. `...` is generally used as a placeholder for the other parts of the code. I can't believe I had to mention this, but a friend was actually confused by it.

### Non-OCIO Guide

You can replicate the transforms farily easily in order to use flim's 3D LUT in your own pipeline without using OCIO. The following pseudo-code demonstrates the general process to transform a single RGB triplet (note that this might not match the latest version).

```py
# Input RGB values (color space: Linear BT.709 I-D65)
col = np.array([4.2, 0.23, 0.05])

# RangeTransform
# (clip negative values, or use a custom gamut compression algorithm)
col = np.maximum(col, 0.0)

# AllocationTransform
col += 0.00048828125  # offset by 2 to the power of -11 (lower bound after log2)
col = np.log2(col)
col = map_range(col, from=[-11, 12], to=[0, 1], clamp=True)

# Sample from the 3D LUT (output color space: sRGB 2.2)
out = lut.sample(TRILINEAR, col)
```
